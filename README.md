# Lecture Notes for Probability and Computation

This repository contains the LaTeX source for my lecture notes 
about the Part II Unit of Assessment 'Probability and Computation'
as lectured by John Sylvester, Nicol√°s Rivera, Luca Zanetti and 
Thomas Sauerwald in 2019. 

Their prupose is to support my learning for the 2020 iteration of 
the course, and that of anyone who feels they might profit from 
the notes. As such, please be aware that *they come without 
guarantees about correctness, completeness, quality and 
helpfulness*. They are written very much with myself in mind, and
therefore go in much more detail than the course itself in some
places where this proved necessary for me to be satisfied.
